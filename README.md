# Important notes
In order to be able to use the carousel fragment properly you need to have JQuery enabled in your portal. To do so you need to:
1. Go to Control Panel --> Configuration --> System Settings
2. In the Platform section click on "Third party"
3. Click on "JQuery" on the left
4. Enable the checkbox that says "Enable JQuery"
5. Click on "Update"
